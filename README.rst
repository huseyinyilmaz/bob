Bob is a utility for:

1) Downloading fresh copy of a repository.
2) Build docker image from root directory of project.
3) Optionally push built image to a remote docker repo.

With assigning defaults with environment variables, bob becomes very usefull for people who need to build repos on fresh repos.
